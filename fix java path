Found the problem I have set Environmental Variables in /etc/environment which caused the system.

export JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_121
export JRE_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/jre
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/bin:/opt/jdk1.8.0_121/jre/bin

FIX : PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH

Then , THe issue resolved, Remove the content in the /etc/environment file. Happy Fixing ðŸ˜‰
